{"name":"Muda","tagline":"Multiple Upload Directory Assistant - An image dumper script for imageboards","body":"MUDA - Multiple Upload Directory Assistant (alternatively: 無駄)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMuda is a directory dumper script originally written for 8chan. Given a directory, a thread, and a board, it will dutifully post all images in the directory automatically, leaving you to do other things.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n* Ruby 2.1.x\r\n* Bundler\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n------------\r\n * Install bundler (`gem install bundler`) to manage dependencies\r\n * Kick off bundler to install dependencies: `bundle install`\r\n * In case of errors, you're probably having trouble compiling the stuff that comes with Mechanize.\r\n * Run the script with the help option to see full details: `./muda.rb --help`\r\n * Please report any bugs here :)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMinimum required: `./muda.rb --thread 123456 --board b --directory /home/anon/images`\r\n\r\nOther options are available and mostly self-explanatory. Examine the output of `--help` to customize your dump by setting name, email, body text, and more.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\nShould work with any vichan/infinite based site by default. Other sites will require mucking about with the code that locates and fills the post form.\r\n \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n   Copyright 2015 TKWare Enterprises\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
